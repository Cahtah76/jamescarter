Well I am 6'4, yeah I know a giant please hold the how is the weather up there jokes.  I love my family and friends. I work really hard and hopefully that is the reason you are here.  I am a web developer and a business professional.  I love sports and coach little league football at Brighton. If you are thinking about me designing your website and you are wondering why you should pick me over anyone else let me try to sway you.  I have always said if someone gives me just an opportunity to show them I can do it, whatever it may be at the time, I won't waste that opportunity I will prove it to you every single day.  I am known as the grinder wherever I go.  I may not be the best or the brightest but I am the hardest working and that makes up for anything I may be lacking.  I actually created this whole site you are on in one night.  Not to say I am amazingly fast,  thats not the case, I just work hard at everything I do. well I hope that sways you if not call me up lets have a chat. Thanks for getting to know me.</p1>
